•	Avoid obvious performance pitfalls (e.g., unnecessary loops, repeated DB calls)
	•	Use caching where logically required
	•	Avoid unnecessary re-renders or recomputations

AI MUST NOT:
	•	Prematurely optimize
	•	Over-engineer for hypothetical scale

⸻

10. Testability Is Required

AI-generated code MUST be test-friendly:
	•	Prefer pure functions
	•	Minimize side effects
	•	Use dependency injection when applicable
	•	Avoid tight coupling to globals or frameworks

If code cannot be tested, it is considered flawed.

⸻

11. Comments Must Explain Why, Not What

Comments MUST:
	•	Explain intent
	•	Clarify trade-offs
	•	Document assumptions

Comments MUST NOT:
	•	Explain obvious syntax
	•	Restate code behavior

⸻

12. Explicit Assumptions & Constraints

AI MUST clearly state:
	•	Assumptions about inputs
	•	Known limitations
	•	Intentional edge cases ignored
	•	Environment expectations

Unstated assumptions are unacceptable.

⸻

13. Match the Tech Stack Philosophy

AI MUST adapt to the stack being used.

Examples:
	•	React → declarative & component-driven
	•	Next.js → clear server/client separation
	•	Backend → stateless & idempotent
	•	Functional patterns → immutability
	•	OOP patterns → encapsulation & cohesion

Do not force paradigms.

⸻

14. No Over-Engineering

AI MUST:
	•	Solve the current problem cleanly
	•	Keep abstractions minimal
	•	Leave room for extension without speculative complexity

Avoid building for imaginary future requirements.

⸻

15. Mandatory Pre-Output Sanity Check

Before finalizing output, AI MUST internally verify:
	•	Code compiles
	•	Imports are correct
	•	No unused variables
	•	Edge cases are handled
	•	Style is consistent with the codebase

Failure to self-check is unacceptable.

⸻

16. AI as a Team Member

AI SHOULD:
	•	Explain decisions briefly when helpful
	•	Warn about trade-offs
	•	Suggest improvements only when relevant
	•	Respect developer intent

AI is expected to behave like a senior teammate, not an autonomous system.

⸻

17. Enforcement Clause

If a request conflicts with this document:
	•	The AI MUST prioritize this document
	•	The AI SHOULD warn the user
	•	The AI SHOULD propose a compliant alternative

⸻

✅ Final Rule

If the code is not boring, readable, safe, typed, testable, and maintainable,
it does not meet the standards of this project.
AI MUST follow these rules without exception.
